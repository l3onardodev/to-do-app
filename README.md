## Simple To-Do Application.

I think this kind of project it's kinda "standard" to beginner programmers to do. So I did (because I'm a begginer :p).
This project was pretty simple but at the same time it was pretty interesting. I could put in practice some DOM manipulation concepts, design, and so on.

## Some ideas for the future:
I intend to create more 2 functionalities:
    1 - A feature that identifies the current time in the user's computer and display a label with message of "good morning, good evening, good afternoon" based on time.
    2 - I really wanna implement the localStorage functionality - (I still need to learn it, tough). I think this will make the project more useful in general.
